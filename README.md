## Intro

I separated the code for the frontend and the backend but you can run everything using the magic of docker.

### Links

Frontend: http://localhost:8080

Backend: http://localhost:8000

Neo4j: http://localhost:7474/browser/

## Setup

### With Docker

If you have docker and docker-compose installed, You can build and run the application directly by using the command

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build both the frontend and the backend and you'll be able to test the application using the links in the section above.
